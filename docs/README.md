## libxd

> A simple 2D graphics library for C++.

## What is libxd?
libxd is a C++ library that offers you a collection of intuitive functions to create your own 2D graphics applications. These could be games, artistic visualizations or even highly sophisticated physics simulations. Prior knowledge of C++ is useful but not mandatory. libxd could as well be used as a tool to learn C++. Being OpenGL-based, libxd highly profits from hardware accelerated rendering. As a user of this library you will however never be exposed to any of the OpenGL-related API calls. libxd is compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows.

#### [Reference](outline.md)

This project is inspired by [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Keep in mind, libxd is a new interpretation, not an emulation or port.
